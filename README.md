# MER Narratives Triangulation R Shiny App

Note: Only modules and functions in this repo!

This tool triangulates Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting (MER) narratives with indicator results.
The Narratives Triangulation Tool takes in MER Narratives and MER Structured Datasets (MSD) providing cross-filtering between the two data sources.
Once the required data sources have been imported, the pivot table visualizer can be used to investigate the content of the selected narrative using the MER indicators.
This tool also has advanced features for textual analysis of the narratives including sentiment analysis, tf-idf, n-grams and correlations.
